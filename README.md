_Exploring the beauty of simple web design_

## Description

A little [hobby site](https://luvi.net/) and space on the internet to express myself, share my hobbies, and play with tools. This is mainly intended to experiment and learn HTTP and CSS (no JavaScript here). Ansible is used to for site templating, certificate management, and site content deployment. Inspired by sites like [](https://cat-v.org/), this site is powered by [werc]().

### Prerequisites

Using this code assumes this is being deployed on webserver running:

- A modern version of [OpenBSD](https://oepnbsd.org/).
- An installation of [plan9](https://9fans.github.io/plan9port/).
- A running CGI---the werc [documentation](https://werc.cat-v.org/docs/web-server-setup/) explains things nicely.

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.

## Project status

I have quite a few ideas for things I'd like to do on this site. I'll get to updating it as I get the chance. A lot of commits are gonna me uploading memes ;P
