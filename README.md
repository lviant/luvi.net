# luvi.net

_Exploring the beauty of simple web design_

## Description

A little [hobby site](https://luvi.net/) and space on the internet to express myself, share my hobbies, and play with tools. This is mainly intended to experiment and learn HTTP and CSS (no JavaScript here). [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/index.html) is used to for site templating, certificate management, and site content deployment. Inspired by sites like [cat-v.org](https://cat-v.org/), this site is powered by [werc](https://werc.cat-v.org/).

### Prerequisites

Using this code as is assumes this is being deployed on webserver running:

- A modern version of [OpenBSD](https://openbsd.org/).
- An installation of [plan9](https://9fans.github.io/plan9port/).
- A running CGI&mdash;the werc [documentation](https://werc.cat-v.org/docs/web-server-setup/) explains things nicely.

## Project status

I have quite a few ideas for things I'd like to do on this site. I'll get to updating it as I get the chance. A lot of commits are gonna me uploading memes. ;P
